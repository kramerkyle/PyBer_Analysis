# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to inform decision makers at PyBer about material differences in operation between city types. After discussing the results in the summary data frame and the fare by type chart.

# Results
## Data Frame
Referencing the Summary Data Frame, it is clear that the majority of the rides take place within urban markets. This should come as no surprise given the population size. Suburban markets are about 1/3rd of the size and the rural market is approximately 1/13th the size.

Although the absolute mass is bigger in urban markets, the unit economics are far more appealing for drivers in rural markets. Rural drivers have garnered an average of $55.49 in fares versus urban driver's $16.57.

## Fare Chart by Type
The fare chart clearly visualizes the difference between markets on a week to week basis. From this chart, we see that there was a significant jump in fares across all markets in the last week of February. Following this rise, however, the suburban market saw fares dramaticaly drop.

The most stable market in absolute terms appears to be the rural market. This would make sense if there are a reliable group of drivers and riders that have incorporated PyBer into their routine.

# Summary
## Recommendation 1
The first recommendation to PyBer is to expand the scope of the data analysis. The analysis would benefit layering in data on repeat riders, repeat drivers, average rating by riders, average rating by drivers, and proximity to other markets. By aggregating this information, PyBer would have greater ability to evaluate market performance and brand satisfaction.

## Recommendation 2
After evaluating market performance more holistically, PyBer will have the opportunity to launch training programs for drivers to raise guest satisfaction. Not only that, but marketing can be tailored and deployed to better attract + retain guests.

## Recommendation 3
Finally, PyBer should ensure that its urban drivers are being taken care of. There were more drivers than rides in the given time period. It may be beneficial to restrict the number of drivers on the basis of quality so that guests have the best experience and existing drivers have a greater opportunity to earn a living.
